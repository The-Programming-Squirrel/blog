- term: Zero-day vulnerability
  definition: A zero-day is a security flaw or weakness in software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the vendor or developer, making it vulnerable to exploitation by attackers before a fix or patch is released. The term “zero-day” refers to the fact that the vendor has “zero days” to fix the vulnerability because they are unaware of it, and thus there is no protection available when the vulnerability is first discovered.
