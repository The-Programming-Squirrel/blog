## Who is this blog for? üêøÔ∏è

This blog targets a tech-savvy, forward-thinking audience interested in cybersecurity, technology trends, and digital innovation. It's particularly appealing to:

1. **Cybersecurity Enthusiasts:** Professionals, hobbyists, and students looking to stay informed about the latest trends, tools, and best practices in cybersecurity.
2. **Tech Blog Explorers:** Readers who enjoy discovering fresh unique voices in the tech blogging world, especially with playful and engaging tone.
3. **Digital Learners:** Individuals seeking accessible and actionable content for improving their cybersecurity knowledge or earning certifications.
4. **Industry Insiders:** Tech professionals, content creators, and influencers who are interested in building connections or partnerships with new blogs.

## Why a Cybersecurity Blog? üõ°Ô∏è

Cybersecurity is quickly taking over our lives. From the rising sophistication of foreign and domestic {% glossary Cybercrimes, display: cybercrimes %} to government deployment of AI to protect our sensitive data; the world is a very different place now. Below is an infographic put out by {% glossary NIST %}[^1] highlighting the integral role these technologies are playing in this spy v. spy tug of war.

{% figure caption: "*An infographic designed by NIST outlining both the threat and the protection possible using AI models in the cyber industry. (Source: <https://www.nist.gov/mep/manufacturing-infographics/cybersecurity-strengthens-us-manufacturers>)*" label:nist class: "fig-container" %}
![Cybersecurity infographic by NIST](/assets/infographics/infographic-cyber-AI.png)
{% endfigure %}

AI is playing a huge role in this cascading effect. Hackers are able to employ natural language models to trick victims into giving up valuable information or use data mining to gather vast amounts of {% glossary PII (Personally Identifiable Information), display: PII %} for use in phishing or ransomware attacks. Meanwhile, world governments utilize AI to leverage encryption algorithms as well as gather intelligence and incite cyberwarfare. This is the battlefield of today, fought not on land or water but on bytes.

If you look carefully at {% figref nist %}, there are plenty of measures one can take to stay on top of their own privacy, but will it ever be enough? It seems like even as the good guys get good, the bad guys get worse... In walk, bigger good guys. And then even badder bad guys. And on and on the wheel goes. But this feedback loop is perhaps the greatest reason that we need to invest our time and energy into the subject, because it's either we do it or *they* do.

### Why Does the World Need Another Cybersecurity Blog?

One of the major pain points I hear on the subject of cybersecurity is that its jargon and rapid pace make it difficult to tread water. That there aren't enough hours in the day to read every {% glossary CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), display: CVE %} or {% glossary Zero-day vulnerability, display: zero-day %} report. And to some extent, this is pretty true. I mean, cyber moves fast! The vulnerability remediation timeline (the time from detection to patch release) on the most critical CVEs is usually between 5 and 14 days but can run up to 39 days if the bug is less severe[^2]. These findings were corroborated by Google's Threat Intelligence team who found that hackers only have between 1 and 4 days to exploit before a patch is released, a number that's going down overall[^3].

> ### üñäÔ∏è Note
>
> Links to both of these peer reviewed reports can be found at the bottom of the article in the [Footnotes üîó](#footnotes-) section. You may also follow the footnote quick reference links.

Protecting clients' data, especially in response to a breach is of the utmost importance. Quick recovery is key to not only saving your reputation in the tech industry but also your bottom line. Adding to the drama of the business, Government sanctions and incentives have become a common way to combat flagrant negligence security compliance as law-makers struggle to keep data leaks from destabilizing industry. In the healthcare for instance, {% glossary HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), display: HIPAA %} standards and benchmarks put a price on protecting patients' health-related PPI to the tune of millions of USD for mishandling a single case. Cyber jobs are risky business! If you think like me, that's also what makes cybersecurity so enticing for insiders that get it.

Perhaps the biggest detractor from jumping headlong into a cyber career is the lack of any practical way to gain a foothold in the industry. The roadmap to becoming a, say a {% glossary Cybersecurity analyst, display: cybersecurity analyst %}, or {% glossary Penetration tester (Pentester), display: penetration tester %} is not only expensive, requiring both a college degree and ongoing certifications, but it's also contradictory at times. First you need this many years of experience, then you need these certifications, but to get these certifications you need this experience and these networking connections. I have boiled down a little of what these qualifications are to give you an idea, but this is by no means the best or only path; heck, it's probably not even the exact one we will follow throughout our cyber education at The-Programming-Squirrel. It's just a hyper-high-level analysis of top careers in the industry and how to qualify for them.

**Qualifications for Various Cyber Job Titles and Respective Pay Benefit Summary:**

 1. **Years of Experience:** Entry-level jobs (0-2 years); Mid-level (2-5 years); Senior-level (5-10 years).
 2. **Education:** A bachelor‚Äôs degree is the minimum requirement, with master‚Äôs degrees preferred for executive roles.
 3. **Certifications:** Security+, CEH, CISSP, CISM, OSCP, and others enhance job prospects.
 4. **Most Important Factors:** Certifications, hands-on experience, and continuous learning are key.
 5. **Salary Impact:** Meeting these requirements (with certifications and experience) can increase base salaries by $10,000 to $40,000+ annually, with top executives like CISOs earning significantly more.

Basically, cyber employers want someone who has a degree but who invests there time into keeping up with the hottest trends, languages, {% glossary OpSec (Operational Security), display: OpSec %} standards, and techniques. They want a near-constant commitment to education and honing your skills. Mid-level roles also require 2-5 years of experience which can be tricky if you're just coming out of college, especially in this saturated market. Certification exams are one of the best ways to set yourself apart from everyone in your graduating class. Entry-level certs that you should get immediately are:

- **CompTIA Security+:** Widely recognized for foundational security knowledge.
- **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH):** Excellent for those focused on penetration testing and ethical hacking.
- **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP):** Ideal for those aiming for managerial or higher-level roles.
- **Certified Information Security Manager (CISM):** Helps for those pursuing leadership roles in cybersecurity.
- **Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate:** Good for those focusing on network security operations.

And while those are great starting points, specialized roles like {% glossary Information Security Manager %} and {% glossary Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), display: CISO %} that boast a \$565,000 salary want you to have the following advanced certifications:

- **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP):** Highly respected in the penetration testing and ethical hacking community.
- **Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP):** Key for those entering cloud security.
- **Certified Chief Information Security Officer (CCISO):** Best for individuals targeting executive roles like CISO.
- **GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC):** Ideal for professionals who need to demonstrate their practical security skills.

The bottom-line? You want to be in cyber, trust me, but it's going to be tough getting there. That's where we come in with the big guns. Study guides, cheat sheets, labs, synthesis and notes for certification exam studies, and a one-of-a-kind open and inclusive community are all waiting for you here at The-Programming-Squirrel. This blog and our host of resources in various mediums and platforms simplifies cybersecurity topics and presents them in a playful, relatable tone that can appeal to everyone, from novices to seasoned professionals.

{% endfigure %}

### Who's Behind The-Programming-Squirrel

Currently, our small team consists mainly of Nyki and a few helping minds that advise her but who wish to remain anonymous. As a brand in its infancy, Nyki wears many hats. To her credit, the orchestration of complex, multilayered projects is part of what gives her an edge in the industry. Originally majoring in mathematics, she took her first computer science course in freshman year as a general education requirement; the rest is history. From that first class (Intro to Python and Java) to today, she has never stopped picking up new languages and skills; often starting and then restarting projects as she goes down the "coding rabbit-hole". Her appetite for all things programming is voracious and borderline obsessive. But her love of the struggle fuels the intensity necessary to run The-Programming-Squirrel.

What started as tutoring in math for work study soon became a private venture where she would host study events on Discord for classmates. With her phone on an extendible arm above the desk, she would walk her peers through problems, carefully explaining the do's, don'ts, and "gotchas" of the concepts. Prior to this, she had enjoyed documenting her personal coding projects and translating them into detailed tutorials that she'd post to her [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Programming-Squirrel) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/28417837/the-programming-squirrel) hoping they'd save some coder, somewhere in need. These endeavors became such a joy for Nyki, she knew she had to streamline the knowledge sharing process and devote time to this growing passion. The brainchild of this coming-of-age story is The-Programming-Squirrel, a space for exploration, deep-understanding, networking, certification exam-kicking awesomeness. A place to strengthen your skills regularly so you can land the job of your dreams and have a little fun along the way!

In cyber, it's all about accessibility and often, who you know. So the community aspects cannot be overlooked here. With a budding following on Discord and a social media presence on several popular platforms, there's a space for everybody at this table. Hosting discussions, special live events, challenges and labs, study groups, and so much more, The-Programming-Squirrel and it's brand are both a trusted source for cyber resources and a candid forum for authentic discourse. Join us as we break down barriers, empower ourselves and other to succeed in the cyber industry, and overall \#win at life!

## What to Expect from The-Programming-Squirrel üì•

So what types of content will The-Programming-Squirrel cover? In the beginning at least, much of the content will focus on passing those certification exams. Starting of course with the [CompTIA Security+ certification exam](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security). To keep things as interactive as possible, we will most likely be jumping back-and-forth between that and the Burp Suite Certified Practitioner labs on [Portswigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security). Both of these certs are a feather in any young cyber analyst's cap. Regularly we will feature certification refresher courses as well as news updates via our digital newsletter regarding changes to exam curricula or concepts. The cyber world is constantly evolving, staying up-to-date with the latest ethical hacking techniques and breaking bugs will be paramount to staying at the top of your field.

You can also expect tutorials and lab walkthroughs for popular online hacking courses including [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [Portswigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security), and more. Often, these will take the form of a blog article but we will experiment with video formats and platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo. Taking the time to go through these walkthroughs will play a big role in developing your knowledge base and challenging your to solve puzzles on a regular basis. This will be the bread and butter of our brand.

Finally, community platforms such as Discord and social media posts will round out content offerings by providing a space to converse with others cyber hopefuls and professionals. Diversity and inclusion are values at the very heart of The-Programming-Squirrel's inception. Cultivating a community of positivity and growth cannot be done alone and requires every one of you to be successful. Respond to posts and answer questions if you are knowledgeable. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there because you never know who can be a friend or resource in the future. We will try our best to be active and personally available to answer any questions or listen to your valuable feedback. DM us on any of our socials and we will take care to respond within 1-2 days usually.

{% include social-media-links.html %}

### How Often Will the Blog Be Updated?

Content schedules will be posted to across our socials in the *Monthly Social Media Schedule*. At least in the beginning, these schedules will be tentative as we integrate The-Programming-Squirrel into our busy lives but we will do our best to keep regular updates and new content rolling out. Subscribing to [The-Programming-Squirrel Newsletter](https://wkf.ms/3Cgyj22) will be your most direct line to what's going on, not only within our community but the greater cyber world.
